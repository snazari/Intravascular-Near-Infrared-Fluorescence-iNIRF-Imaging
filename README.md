# Intravascular-Near-Infrared-Fluorescence-iNIRF-Imaging
MATLAB based matched filter is implemented for an iNIRF imaging method
Intravascular near infrared fluorescence imaging (iNIRF) is used to detect plaque in blood vessels. Attenuation of the iNIRF signal is known to vary with the distance between the plaque and the sensor. This MATLAB model implements a matched filter that explicitly learns and leverages the relationship between target distance and attenuation for near optimal detection.
